# Liminal AI Sales Finder Agent

## Overview
The Liminal AI Sales Finder Agent is an intelligent assistant designed to help Liminal account holders make better purchasing decisions. The agent will first analyse the user’s historical transaction data, then identify cheaper or more suitable alternative products and give the user clear recommendations directly within Liminal’s chat interface, which the user can then take action upon.

Our goal is to reduce unnecessary spending made by users, eliminate prior product research to save time and provide users with confidence that they are making informed and ethical purchasing decisions.

## What Software Are We Creating?
We are designing a Sales Finder AI Agent that analyses past purchases made by Liminal users and determines whether more cost-effective or better-suited alternatives exist.

We have split the system into four key components:
### 1. Receipt Reader
Extracts and interprets data received from a user’s purchasing history, including product type, category, and price.

### 2. Competitor Finder
Searches for similar products offered by alternative companies or providers and lists them to the system.

### 3. Product Comparator
Compares the original purchase against the available alternatives received, highlighting the differences in price, value and potential benefits.

### 4. Chat Output Agent
Sends recommendations from the information gathered to Liminal’s chat system in a clear, readable and user-friendly format.

## Project Aim
We have designed this project to align with Liminal’s values of user consent, privacy, and transparency. The agent will only analyse authorised transaction data and can provide explainable and easy to understand recommendations.

Additionally, our project explores how analysis generated by AI services can be integrated into blockchain-based banking systems. By automating sales comparison and utilising pattern recognition, the system shows how artificial intelligence can improve efficiency for both users and financial services, allowing for more attention to be paid to on security, decentralisation and ethical spending.

## Goals
Our primary goals for this project are:

- Develop a **professional, modular system** that can be adapted or extended by a second-party developer
- Minimise the need for manual product research by users, reducing uncertainty and decision fatigue
- Help users feel confident that their purchases are **cost-effective, reliable, and ethically sourced**
- Gain a deeper understanding of **sales patterns within blockchain-based banking systems** and apply this knowledge to intelligent recommendation logic

## Features
The Liminal AI Sales Finder Agent currently includes:

- Analysis of recent transaction history
- Alternative product suggestions based on past purchases
- A recent transactions list for contextual recommendations
- A chatbot interface that allows users to communicate directly with the agent through Liminal
- Insight generation that explains *why* an alternative may be beneficial

## How Does This Help Customers?
This tool empowers Liminal users to make smarter financial decisions by:

- Identifying cheaper or more suitable alternatives quickly
- Saving time by eliminating manual research
- Increasing transparency around spending choices
- Helping users maximise value while maintaining trust and safety

Overall, it enables users to spend more efficiently while staying informed and in control.

## Challenges Encountered
During development, we encountered several technical issues, including:

- Difficulties connecting to required APIs
- Network and Wi-Fi instability
- Environment variable misconfiguration (incorrectly naming the `.env` file), which caused significant debugging delays

These challenges provided valuable experience in debugging, configuration management, and development workflows.

## Limitations and Future Improvements
While functional, the current version of the project has limitations:

- Limited time for user testing and feedback integration
- Alternative suggestions are based on recent insights rather than long-term learning
- Product matching could be improved with richer datasets and broader competitor coverage

Future improvements could include:

- More advanced pattern analysis over longer transaction histories
- Improved recommendation accuracy using additional data sources
- Enhanced explainability and customisation options for users
