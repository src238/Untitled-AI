## What software are we creating?
We are creating and designing a Sales Finder AI Agent to search through the history of previous purchases made by Liminal account holders to determine what the most optimal and advantageous crypto-based purchases would be for them. The agent will determine the best possible profit for both the company and the customer and help them to make the best choice they can on purchases and investments. We will split the workload of the program into 4 sections: a receipt reader to retrieve information on previous purchases, a competitor finder to determine similar products produced by other companies, alongside a product comparator to determine and inform the user of potential benefits this product would have over the found products and finally an output program that prints this information to Liminal's chat system.
## What is the aim of our project?
We aim to create a project that.
## What are our goals?
One of our goals includes creating and finalising this project in a professional manner which can be adapted to the liking of the clientele and any users. While we likely will not have the time for user feedback, we wish to implement it up to the stage where customers can use it and it can be easily adapted by a second-party.
